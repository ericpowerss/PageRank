# PageRank
## Project 2 - Data Structures

Welcome to my pagerank project.  This project uses an adjacency list to implementing a simple version of Google's page ranking algorithm that decides which websites get priority over the other if somebody were to search for something on Google. The adjaceny list is implemented within "AdjacencyList.h" and my report relfects on some of the different time complexities of my methods. My concluding thoughts on the project are also included at the bottom of the report.
